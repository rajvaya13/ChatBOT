# ChatBOT

An advanced chatbot powered by cutting-edge Large Language Models, built with Python and LLM (Large Language Model) technology.

## Dependencies (assuming Windows)

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
pip install pylzma numpy ipykernel jupyter torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118


> **Note**: If you don't have an NVIDIA GPU, then the `device` parameter will default to 'cpu' since `device = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'. If `device` is defaulting to 'cpu', that is fine; you will just experience slower runtimes.
